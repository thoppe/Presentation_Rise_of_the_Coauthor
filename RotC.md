Motivation

====

Is science really changing?

====+
<br>
# _YES!_

PDB submissions, NIH budgets, Number of postdoctoral/doctoral bio-medical students, Number of international collaborations, ...

====*
## Submissions to PDB

!(img/EM_pdb.jpg) <<height:250px>>
!(img/NMR_pdb.jpg) <<height:250px>>

Electron Microscopy, NMR

IMG: Number of international collaborations

====

Purpose of this talk is to examine the perspective on journal authorship and any other interesting facts from front-end of a journal

====*

## Methods

Journal studied: Science, Nature, Cell, JCI, PNAS, JACS, JBC

For every journal, every table of contents was downloaded. This gives titles and authorship information for every paper.

Filtered for editorials, corrections, errata, book reviews, ...

====*

## Consortia

LARGE project collaborations

Removed from study

Examples:

Genome (link)
Mars Rover (link)
Etc (link)

## Coauthorship is on the rise

## Extrapolate?

## Correlated to growth?

## Single Authorship

====
## Lexicographical analysis

Look for _significant_ keywords in the titles

+ Remove *stop words*:

e.g. [the,first,has]

+ Apply *stemming*, *lemmatization*:

(acids, acidic) $\rightarrow$ acid

Identify a canonical representative set for related words

## Verbosity Saturates

# Reasons?

+ More money == More science?
+ New science requires international collaborations, e.g. all the low hanging fruit is gone
+ White bull effect?
+ Diluted second authors?

Is this a bad thing? What is lost?
